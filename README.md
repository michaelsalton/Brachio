Brach.io is a unique and engaging finance tracking application built using C++. This innovative app features a visual representation of an island filled with dinosaurs that can grow and shrink based on the performance of your stocks. The concept of the application is similar to the popular app Plant Nanny. Brach.io allows you to track your finance and stock portfolio in a fun and interactive way. As your stocks increase in value, your dinosaurs will grow; as your stocks decrease in value, your dinosaurs will shrink. Stay on top of your finances and watch your dinosaurs thrive with Brach.io.

The project's primary focus is to develop software that can effectively track and display the performance of the user's stocks in real-time. The application will be designed to run on Raspberry Pi, a single-board computer that can be used for various projects. Using Raspberry Pi will enable the application to be easily accessible and portable. In terms of the software elements, the application will be developed using C++ and will utilize libraries such as QT to visually represent the island and dinosaurs. The application will also use APIs to fetch real-time stock data from various sources.
